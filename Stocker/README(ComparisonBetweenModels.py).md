Analysis

Bayesian Neural Network (BNN)
* Strengths: Captures broader trends and is responsive to changes in stock prices.
* Weaknesses: Overestimates the closing prices, resulting in a higher predicted trend compared to the actual prices.

XGBoost
* Strengths: Produces conservative and more stable predictions.
* Weaknesses: Underestimates the closing prices, leading to lower predicted values compared to the actual prices.

Averaged Predictions
* Strengths: Provides a balanced approach by combining the strengths of both models, resulting in closer approximations to the actual prices.
* Weaknesses: Still shows some deviation from the actual prices but improves overall prediction accuracy.

Conclusion
The BNN model tends to overpredict while the XGBoost model underpredicts the adjusted closing prices. Averaging the results of both models offers a more balanced prediction, yielding a closer approximation to the actual stock prices.
