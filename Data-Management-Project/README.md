Data Management Project: 

This application is a simple console-based shopping simulator implemented in Python. The user interacts with the program through a command-line interface, choosing between options like user registration, login, and various shopping-related actions. The program maintains a list of users, each having a password and a shopping cart. Users can view a list of products, filter and sort them, add items to their carts, remove items, and view the contents of their carts.

**Languages Used:**
- **Python#:** The primary programming language for the application. 
- **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation):** Used for storing and retrieving user data. 

This application demonstrates fundamental programming concepts such as user input, data manipulation, file I/O, and basic user authentication.
